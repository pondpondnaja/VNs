## Story
----
The final chapter of the NEKO-NIN exHeart series is here!

“We have arrived from the Fuuma Village in order to serve you, sir!”

…It’s already been a few months since that fated day when those cute cat-eared ninjas came to our hero’s doorstep with that line. With two new additions to the family in Ritsu and Maya, his daily life has gotten that much more bright, cheerful, and rambunctious.

However, as expected? As is fated! New developments arise that bring tense situations to a head.

“I am the next leader of the Saiga Clan! Successor to the Magoichi name… Saiga Himari!”

Out appeared a beautiful yet high-handed young lady and her two retainers. What is this girl’s objective? What is the Saiga Clan? This modern day ninja drama enters its third act. With amped-up cuteness in store, it will meow meow you for sure.
