## Story
----
Japan. 
From time immemorial, there are those who possess superhuman abilities. These beings who looked like a cross between man and beast are called Demi-Humans. They acted as Ninja and served those in power.

And so time passes to present day——

“We have come from the Fuuma Village to fulfill an ancient contract. To serve you! Nin ♪”

Yura and Tama. These Ninja cats made their dynamic entrance. They approached our hero with their loving aura in full bloom. Their adorableness and will causes our hero to be taken by them. But how will he support them? How on earth do you use Ninja in this day and age? As he ponders this question, the sense of being a master begins to sprout in our hero when he interacts with these lovely cats.

But who is spying on them from the shadows…?

A mysterious Ninja named Ritsu shows up to the village, but who is she targeting? Haruki takes in a bunny-eared Ninja named Maya who has lost her memories and claims she’s actually a cat! This causes some tension within the household. A new heartfelt tale of adorable catgirl Ninjas, action, and mystery begins!
